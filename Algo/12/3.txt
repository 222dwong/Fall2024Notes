S = set of vertices you can reach from s in c_f

Ford-Fulkerson - |F| augmentations
    Complexity = O(|E||F|)

Edmonds Kap- "shortest" augmenting path -> BFS -> (EV) augmentations 
    Complexity = O(E^2 * V)


Given s and t, find paths that dont take the same edge

    sol: think of capacities = 1

Bipartite Matching Problem:
Proper Matching Condition:
    N(S) >= |S|
